# HR Database with Flask and Sqlalchemy


## Methodological Thoughts


## Use Case for this App
The imagined user would be someone working in an HR department who needs to manage a database of employees. The user should be able to:
* View all employees :white_check_mark:
* View all departments :white_check_mark:
* For each department, view all the employees 
* Add an employee :white_check_mark:
* Add a department
* Delete employees 
* Delete departments 
* Edit employee details
* Edit department details                   
* Add an employee to a department  
* Delete an employee from a department 

### Key
* :white_check_mark: success! I have achieved this feature.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: I have been able to achieve this feature to some extent, but not completely. 

## Areas I Would Like to Work on in Future
